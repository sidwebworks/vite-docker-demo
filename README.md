# Example for running Vite inside Docker

## Clone this repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sidwebworks/vite-docker-demo.git
```

## Build and run the container using docker-compose

```sh
docker-compose up --build
```

> You can ignore the `--build` flag if its the first time you're running the compose command, as it will auto build.

# Rest everything should work _fine_.
